Exp 01: All zero: oscillates around the string and flipped eventually. All rotor responses are the same.
Exp 02: Default pitch controller + default pitch rate controller: stabilzed along string very well. Rotor responses are two curves.
Exp 03: Default pitch PD controller + default pitch rate controller: stablized along string very well. Rotor responses are two curves.
Exp 02 and 03 => I in pitch controller is not necessary. Since D = 0 in the default pitch controller, we know a simple P controller
for pitch is sufficient.
Exp 04: Default pitch P controller + default pitch rate PD controller: stablized along string very well. Rotor responses are two curves.
Now we know P + PD are sufficient to have a good pitch controller.
Exp 05: Default pitch P controller + default pitch rate P controller: vibrates at high frequency but low magnitude but was able to stablize
along the string relatively well overall. Rotor responses show very high frequenct oscillations.
Exp 04 and 05 => This shows that D in pitch rate damps the motion, which I guess makes sense.
Exp 06: Pitch PD controller only. We set P and D gains so that it is theoretically equivalent to Exp 05: P = pitch P * pitch rate P in Exp 05
and D = pitch rate P in Exp 05 (we have already converted the units). P = 1500; D = 250.
It starts to vibrate immediately with an increasing magnitude that quickly goes out of control. Eventually it flipped over and the experiment
is terminated. This is very similar to what we observe in our past experiments.
